            <h3>How DS-Converter Works</h3>
            <p>DS-Converter is built on a solid foundation of fundamental data structure algorithms and string manipulation techniques. Here's a breakdown of how it works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Expression Conversion:</strong> Using stack-based algorithms, the tool converts infix expressions to postfix or prefix formats for easy evaluation.</li>
                <li><strong>Stack Visualization:</strong> A stack data structure is used to handle operations, and the changes in the stack are visualized instantly to reinforce learning.</li>
                <li><strong>String Manipulation:</strong> Basic string operations such as reversing, palindrome checking, and case conversion are handled by built-in JavaScript methods to deliver quick results.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Benefits of Using DS-Converter</h3>
